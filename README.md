# 🎓 Student Grade Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates a student's **final grade** based on their **academic performance across in quiz, assignments and mid term**. 

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Education professionals often face challenges in identifying students who may underperform. This project addresses that gap by developing a machine learning model to:
- **Predict final grades** using historical session data.
- **Highlight students at academic risk**.
- **Enable early intervention** to improve student outcomes.

---

## 🚀 Objective
To create a data-driven tool that:
- Predicts final grades with high accuracy  
- Uses interpretable features relevant to educators  
- Can be adapted for use in schools, colleges, and learning platforms

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – experimentation and EDA

---

## 💡 Potential Use Cases
- Academic advising systems  
- Learning management platforms  
- School administration dashboards  
- Early warning systems for at-risk students
